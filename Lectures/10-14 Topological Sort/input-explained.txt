- top line = 8 vertices, 9 edges
- each line after means an edge connecting the vectors listed
- vertex number is automatically determined based on the order of the first number in each line
8 9
0 1
0 3
3 1
3 2
2 1
4 1
2 4
7 1
7 5


- input redirection
- running './toposort < input.txt' will send the text from input.txt to the program as if it was typed in
- the program thinks it's reading from the keyboard, when it's really reading from a file
- this is a UNIX feature, not a C feature

- can verify sort is correct by checking if the left vertex came before the right vertex in the final output
