Suppose we have some input data of size n.  We want to process this data
using an algorithm which has a running time of f(n), where f(n) is
expressed in microseconds.

For a given f(n), what is the biggest n that we can solve in time t?

Example:

t = 1 hour = 3600 seconds/hour * 1000000 microseconds/second
  = 3.6 * 10⁹ microseconds

If f(n) = lg(n) = 3.6 * 10⁹
then n = 2^(3.6 * 10⁹) which is... a lot.

Note: here lg means log base 2.

If f(n) = n = 3.6 * 10⁹
then n = 3.6 * 10⁹.

If f(n) = n lg(n) = 3.6 * 10⁹
then n = ... ?
In this case we need to solve numerically.
